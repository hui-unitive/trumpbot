Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war. 
I have a great relationship with the Mexican people.    
"You have to think anyway, so why not think big? "
"You know the funny thing, I don't get along with rich people. I get along with the middle class and the poor people better than I get along with the rich people.   "
"Our politicians are stupid. And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them. They don't want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them?   "
"That's one of the nice things. I mean, part of the beauty of me is that I'm very rich. So if I need $600 million, I can put $600 million myself. That's a huge advantage. I must tell you, that's a huge advantage over the other candidates.   "
"Love him or hate him, Trump is a man who is certain about what he wants and sets out to get it, no holds barred. Women find his power almost as much of a turn-on as his money. "
"Part of being a winner is knowing when enough is enough. Sometimes you have to give up the fight and walk away, and move on to something that's more productive.   "
"When somebody challenges you, fight back. Be brutal, be tough.  "
"One of the key problems today is that politics is such a disgrace, good people don't go into government. "
What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate. 
"Experience taught me a few things. One is to listen to your gut, no matter how good something sounds on paper. The second is that you're generally better off sticking with what you know. And the third is that sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make. "
My whole life is about winning. I don't lose often. I almost never lose.
